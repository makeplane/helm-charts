## Pre-requisite

- A working Kubernetes cluster
- `kubectl` and `helm` on the client system that you will use to install our Helm charts

## Installing Plane

  1. Open Terminal or any other command-line app that has access to Kubernetes tools on your local system.
  2. Set the following environment variables.
  
      Copy the format of constants below, paste it on Terminal to start setting environment variables, set values for each variable, and hit ENTER or RETURN.

      ```bash
      PLANE_VERSION=v1.5.1 # or the last released version
      DOMAIN_NAME=<subdomain.domain.tld or domain.tld>
      ```

  3. Add Plane helm chart repo

      Continue to be on the same Terminal window as with the previous steps, copy the code below, paste it on Terminal, and hit ENTER or RETURN.

      ```bash
      helm repo add plane https://helm.plane.so/
      ```

  4. Set-up and customization
      - Quick set-up

        This is the fastest way to deploy Plane with default settings. This will create stateful deployments for Postgres, Rabbitmq, Redis/Valkey, and Minio with a persistent volume claim using the default storage class.This also sets up the ingress routes for you using `nginx` ingress class.
        > To customize this, see `Custom ingress routes` below.

        Continue to be on the same Terminal window as you have so far, copy the code below, and paste it on your Terminal screen.

        ```bash
        helm install plane-app plane/plane-enterprise \
            --create-namespace \
            --namespace plane \
            --set license.licenseDomain=${DOMAIN_NAME} \
            --set planeVersion=${PLANE_VERSION} \
            --set ingress.enabled=true \
            --set ingress.ingressClass=nginx \
            --timeout 10m \
            --wait \
            --wait-for-jobs
        ```

        > This is the basic setup required for Plane-EE. You can customize the default values for namespace and appname as needed. Additional settings can be configured by referring to the Configuration Settings section.<br>

        Using a Custom StorageClass

        To specify a custom StorageClass for Plane-Enterprise components, add the following options to the above `helm upgrade --install` command:
        ```bash
        --set env.storageClass=<your-storageclass-name>
        ```

        

      - Advance set-up

          For more control over your set-up, run the script below to download the `values.yaml` file and and edit using any editor like Vim or Nano. 

          ```bash
          helm  show values plane/plane-enterprise > values.yaml
          vi values.yaml
          ```

          Make sure you set the minimum required values as below.
          - `planeVersion: v1.5.1 <or the last released version>`
          - `license.licenseDomain: <The domain you have specified to host Plane>`
          - `ingress.enabled: <true | false>`
          - `ingress.ingressClass: <nginx or any other ingress class configured in your cluster>`
          - `env.storageClass: <default storage class configured in your cluster>`

            > See `Available customizations` for more details.

          After saving the `values.yaml` file, continue to be on the same Terminal window as on the previous steps, copy the code below, and paste it on your Terminal screen.

          ```bash
          helm install plane-app plane/plane-enterprise \
              --create-namespace \
              --namespace plane \
              -f values.yaml \
              --timeout 10m \
              --wait \
              --wait-for-jobs 
          ```

Set it to `true` to create the issuer. Applicable only when `ingress.enabled=true`|

| ssl.generateCerts | false |  | After creating the issuers, user can still not create the certificate untill sure of configuration. Setting this to `true` will try to generate SSL certificate and associate with ingress. Applicable only when `ingress.enabled=true` and `ssl.createIssuer=true` |

### Common Environment Settings

| Setting | Default | Required | Description |
|---|:---:|:---:|---|
| env.storageClass | &lt;k8s-default-storage-class&gt; |  | Creating the persitant volumes for the stateful deployments needs the `storageClass` name. Set the correct value as per your kubernetes cluster configuration. |
| env.secret_key | 60gp0byfz2dvffa45cxl20p1scy9xbpf6d8c5y0geejgkyp1b5 | Yes | This must a random string which is used for hashing/encrypting the sensitive data within the application. Once set, changing this might impact the already hashed/encrypted data|
